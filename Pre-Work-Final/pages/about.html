				Growing up in Jersey City I attended the local public school in
				downtown. A lot of my close friends were in the school band and would
				usually get excused out of class for band practice and go on trips to
				recitals across the state. What initial started out as a plot to ditch
				class out of boredom, turned into a life-long love and respect for music
				as a discipline, creative medium and means of expression. I joined in
				the 5th grade and went on to playing in a small jazz ensemble for the
				next 3 years till graduation as a part of the
				<strong>NJCU Performing Arts Program</strong>. Though these days I don't
				play much clarinet, I still play guitar as often as I can.

				What I listen to usually depends on what I'm usually doing at the moment
				or if an activity is consistent with a theme. For example when I'm
				coding I usually listen to Synthwave/Chillwave music to focus. Here's
				one of my favorite playlists.

				How I ended up learning to play guitar is a bit of a funny story. I was
				on my way home from a friends house and had seen a discarded guitar in
				the trash in front of a funeral home. It was in horrible condition, it
				had holes in the body and the strings were old and corroded. Despite all
				its flaws, I took it home, clipped the strings, cleaned it up, and
				watched a youtube video on how to restring acoustic guitars. The
				following day I purcharsed a beginners music book for guitars and the
				supplies I needed from the local music shop and got to work
				<em>doing it myself.</em> Fortunate for me I had already known how to
				read sheet music and with my prior experience in the band, tuning and
				using my ear to discern sound, I was able to know if I was able to
				produce the sound I needed to practice effieciently.
